## Slot props

  <button @click="vue-book-effects.flipLeft">Previous Page</button>
  <button @click="vue-book-effects.flipRight">Next Page</button>
</vue-book-effects>
```

For more practical usage, refer to [`src/App.vue`](https://github.com/Sea-DH1/vue-book-effects/blob/main/src/App.vue) (the demo page source).

These properties and methods can also be referred through `$refs` to the `vue-book-effects` component.

## CSS API

You may need to specify the size of view port in your style sheet, directly to
`<vue-book-effects>` element, or to `.viewport` sub-element of vue-book-effects.

If the size is horizontally long and `singlePage` prop is `false` (default), it displays two pages spread, suitable for desktop browsers.
If it's vertically long, it displays single pages, suitable for smartphones.

There are some internal classes.

### `.viewport`

A `<div>` element that contains everything but `<slot>`.
`<slot>` is placed above `.viewport`.

### `.bounding-box`

Approximate bounding box of the displayed images.
Suitable to give `box-shadow`.

## Browser support

Supports modern browsers and IE 11.

## Development
